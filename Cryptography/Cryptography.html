		<h1>Cryptography</h1>
		<p id="description">
			Cryptography is a method of protecting information and
			communications through the use of codes, so that only those for whom
			the information is intended can read and process it. In computer
			science, cryptography refers to secure information and communication
			techniques derived from mathematical concepts and a set of
			rule-based calculations called algorithms, to transform messages in
			ways that are hard to decipher. These deterministic algorithms are
			used for cryptographic key generation, digital signing, verification
			to protect data privacy, web browsing on the internet and
			confidential communications such as credit card transactions and
			email.
